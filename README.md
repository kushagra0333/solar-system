## 🎯 Key Features

- Realistic planet scaling and orbital animation
- Interactive camera movement (pan, zoom, orbit)
- Dynamic lighting simulating sunlight
- Textured spheres for each celestial body
- Modular and clean codebase

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Three.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
